            <h1>The Problem</h1>
            <p>
                The World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations (UN) claim that, as of 2019, 2.2 billion people are without safe drinking water services while 70% of
                of the world's water is consumed by agriculture. Industrialized agriculture also bolsters global warming, which the WHO claims is the cause of 90% of natural disasters.
                Since the agricultural industry controls such a large proportion of the world's fresh water supply, our team decided that attempting to tackle the issue of illegal
                irrigation would help free up water supplies for the general populous and help alleviate some of the pressure that the agricultural industry is putting on our environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first step we established for identifying illegal irrigation was identifying agricultural land. While we found several satellite image datasets that contained agricultural
                plots, we couldn't find studies done on the datasets. As such, we decided to pivot our project to establishing baselines for the BigEarthNet dataset and publishing our
                findings so other researchers could quickly learn about how to effectively use the dataset. We believe this will be an important study for future researchers because it will
                act as a foundation to build on. With this study researchers won't have to waste time and money on storing unnecessary data and training models with unimportant features.

            <h1>Ablation Study</h1>
            <p>
                In order to maintain consistent and informative results about the dataset, we decided to use the ablation study paradigm. Ablation studies, in the context of machine learning,
                are often used to identify the important layers of machine learning models. The ablation paradigm consists of methodically removing layers in a model and recording learning
                results to identify the importance and function of the various layers in a model. We applied the same paradigm to our study of the BigEarthNet dataset. Rather than
                modifying our model, though, we methodically added features to our model and recorded the changes in performance. By using this ablation method, we were able to confidently
                conclude which features we considered to be crucial to the learning process and could give insight as to what effect each feature has on the learning outcome.
                We hope that, by using a strictly scientific way of determining feature importance and feature relationship, future researchers can be better informed about the BigEarthNet
                dataset and therefore be more prepared and educated for their work.
