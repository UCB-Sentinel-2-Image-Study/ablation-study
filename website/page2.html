                The BigEarthNet dataset consists of 590,326 GeoTIFF images that depict birds-eye views of plots of land. The satellite that produced these images was a Sentinel-2 satellite.
                The images were taken between June 2017 and May 2018 and over Austria, Belgium, Finland, Ireland, Kosovo, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Portugal, Serbia, and Switzerland.
                The images are non-overlapping and were labeled using the multiclass labels provided by the 2018 CORINE Land Cover database. BigEarthNet was created by the Remote
                Sensing Image Analysis Group and the Database Systems and Information Management Group at the Technische Universit√§t Berlin.
