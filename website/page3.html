                To begin our study, we converted the labels in the BigEarthNet dataset to binary labels, Agricultural and Not Agricultural. This label indicates whether there is
                agricultural land present in the image. We then established multiple steps where we trained a Keras implementation of the ResNet50 model on different combinations of
                bands and tested the model's performance on predicting the labels of our test set images. For each experiment, we measured accuracy, precision, recall, and loss.
                Once recorded, we proceeded to the next experiment.

                    *These experiments were run in Google Cloud Platform on a NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPU. We attempted to set up more powerful environments on other platforms, but we had issues
                    with the various platforms not providing the hardware we needed to run these experiments. As such, only 4 epochs were run for each experiment, which should be taken into
                    consideration when evaluating the results.

                Our results are split into 3 phases. In phase 1, our leading hypothesis was that the Red, Blue, and Green bands would contain the most information and adding the remaining
                bands would provide minor improvements to our performance measures.

                After completing Phase 1, we identified Vegetation Red Edge and Coastal Aerosol as our auxiliary features that provided the most information to the learning process.
                Going into phase 2, we were interested in seeing how modifying this set of features would affect our performance.

                Phase 2 clued us in on the fact that Vegetation Red Edge and Coastal Aerosol are the key players in our predictions and that RGB actually does very little for us.
                We lost no performance by removing RGB and it actually cut our training time by 80% by cutting the RGB channels. This was a huge step for us in understanding the
                BigEarthNet dataset. We also established that Vegetation Red Edge bands are core to the prediction process. We will use this observation for Phase 3 where
                we will use feature combinations based around the Vegetation Red Edge bands.

            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>
                By the end of Phase 3 we determined our best predictions to be done by the model trained on the Vegetation Red Edge bands and all the infrared bands.
                We also noted that there was not much of a performance loss by only including the SWIR bands with the Vegetation Red Edge. With these results, we hope to
                inform future researchers of the effects each feature has on model performance. We want our findings to act as a foundation to save researchers time and money, so they can
                prioritize the correct features and expedite their studies. We believe further work on the BigEarthNet dataset can lead to environmental and social change that
                could battle global warming and help equalize the share of water between people and industry.
